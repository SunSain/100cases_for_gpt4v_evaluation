Please try to score as objectively as possible.
Please be serious when grading. A flawless poster can only get 10 points. A mediocre poster can only get 7 points. A poster with obvious shortcomings can only get 4 points. A very poor poster can only get 1- 2 points.

Grading rules:

Design and Layout (1-10): The poster should have a clean, balanced, and consistent layout. The design should be visually appealing and make efficient use of white space. A score of 10 would mean a brilliantly designed and well-structured layout that is easy to follow and visually attractive.

Content Accuracy (1-10): The information in the poster should be correct with user intention. A poster that provides accurate and reliable information would score a 10, while misleading or incorrect content would receive a low score.


Relevance (1-10): The content of the poster should be relevant to its purpose or the intended audience. A score of 10 would mean the content is highly relevant and engaging to the target audience, while a score of 1 would mean it is irrelevant or unappealing.

Typography (1-10): The use of fonts, sizes, spaces should be appropriate, readable, and aesthetically pleasing. A score of 10 represents excellent use of typography that enhances readability and aesthetic appeal, while a score of 1 means the placement of the text is wrong or unreasonable.Please carefully consider whether the text placement is compatible with the background image.

Font Color Scheme (1-10): The poster should have a consistent and effective color scheme. A score of 10 would mean the font colors are well-chosen, and contribute positively to the overall design, while a score of 1 means that the size, type, and color of the text are improperly selected, such as being invisible due to mixing with the background color.

Graphics and Images (1-10): Any graphics or images used should be of high quality and relevant to the content. A score of 10 would mean the images are high-quality, relevant, and enhance the overall message, while a 1 would mean they are low-quality or irrelevant.
